# retail-sales
In this project, I carried out an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover valuable insights and to make key recommendations for better business decisions. I used Python and Artificial Intelligence (AI) together with my analytical skills to clean, enhance, analyse, visualise and present key findings.
